 # Hi, Iâ€™m Leanne.

I'm a new Software Engineer looking for projects and work.

I'm currently participating in the Fall 2021 European Cohort of [Front-End Foxes](https://github.com/le-anne/fef-portfolio), [100 Days of Python](https://github.com/le-anne/100DaysofPython), and [66 Days of Data](https://github.com/le-anne/66DaysofData).
